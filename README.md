Harness is a discord bot framework, providing a higher-level interface around discord.py. 

It is built as an alternative to [Breadcord](https://github.com/Breadcord/Breadcord), but far smaller in scope.
Smaller parts of Breadcord source code has been reused in making Harness, primarily the parts contributed by [me](github.com/Fripe070).
